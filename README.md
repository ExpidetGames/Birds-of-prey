## Overall Goal 
As part of our computer science project, we decided to program a multiplayer game. The aim was to program a game by competing with your friends in air combat. So it should be a game in which you fight against each other online with different planes on different worlds in different game modes. For this purpose, the Game Engine Unity is used and programmed in C#. The process for creating the game is described in more detail below. Furthermore, difficulties and their solutions are presented and one's own experiences are described.
